   <p class id="bio">Hello there! My name is Rob Krueger. I enjoy cooking, animals, canoe trips, skiing, travel, video games, long guitar jams, hockey, and sunshine. I am learning to code, and this is my first website!</p>
  <p class id="bio">I started this course at the beginning of May and thus far have quite enjoyed it. I do believe it will take a bit of time to learn the basic .css elements needed to style with proficiency!</p>
  <p class id="bio">My patience is being tested by this assignment! But that is quite alright! My calm demeanor never lets the hours of tedious code mistakes, changes, and general frustration get the better of me! ;-)</p>
